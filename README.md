I am a multidisciplinary scientist with a passion for research, teaching, and industry. My early career focused on numerical modeling in turbulent fluid dynamics, including plasma astrophysics, climatology, and aerodynamics. However, I decided to pivot towards the startup ecosystem and began taking on progressively higher risks, ultimately leading me to become a competitive data scientist.

Over the past few years, I have developed and implemented solutions for various industry clients in the field of Natural Language Processing. Currently, I serve as the CTO at Hunty.com, a Colombian employability startup where we help job seekers find their dream roles.

I am passionate about collaborating with others to create innovative solutions that have a significant impact on society. Let's connect and create something great together!
