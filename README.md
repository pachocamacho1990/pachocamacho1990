## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **physicist turned AI engineering leader**, with a background in computational astrophysics and fluid dynamics (complex abstract stuff !) and years of experience building large-scale NLP and autonomous systems for real-world impact.

My journey began in the realm of computational astrophysics and fluid dynamics—wrestling with complex abstract systems and turning theoretical models into computational solutions. That foundation in physics taught me to think rigorously about complex problems, to question assumptions, and to build systems that can handle real-world chaos.

My work sits at a fascinating intersection: helping organizations build AI systems that are not just powerful, but **secure, explainable, and production-ready**. I've seen too many impressive demos that fall apart in production—my focus is on building systems that actually work when they meet reality.

**Current:** Co-Founder at [Hunty](https://hunty.com) - Scaled platform from MVP to ISO 27001-certified enterprise solution

## 🔭 Current Focus

- 🌱 Learning how to build impactful businesses with new technologies
- 👯 Looking to collaborate on Theory and LLM developments
- 💬 Understanding how to acelerate with different types of AI models the advancements on Computacional fluid Dymamics, my all-time favorite.  
- 💬 Working on Fundamental theoretical Quantum physics, Stochastic Electrodynamics, and QED focused on exploring how to harness quantum phenomena like the Cassimir effect to produce or transport energy at large scales.
