## 🚀 About Me

My journey began in the realm of computational astrophysics and fluid dynamics, wrestling with complex abstract systems and turning theoretical models into computational solutions. That foundation in physics taught me to think rigorously about complex problems, to question assumptions, and to build systems that can handle real-world chaos. My work sits at a particular intersection: helping organizations build AI systems that are not just powerful, but secure, explainable, and production-ready. I've seen too many impressive demos that fall apart in production, my focus is on building systems that actually work when they meet reality.

## What Drives My Work
The transition from physics to AI engineering wasn't about abandoning scientific rigor, it was about applying it to a new domain. In astrophysics, you learn that the universe doesn't care about your elegant theories; the data tells you what's real. The same principle applies to AI systems: they need to perform reliably under real-world conditions, handle edge cases gracefully, and fail safely when they encounter the unexpected.

### On the ML/AI/software technical side, I specialize in:

Vector embeddings and Large Language Models: Building systems that go beyond simple chatbots to take meaningful action on behalf of users
Conversational AI & Agent Systems: Creating autonomous systems that can reason, plan, and execute complex workflows
Security-First Architecture: Designing AI systems with security baked in from the ground up, not bolted on as an afterthought
Enterprise Integration: Connecting AI capabilities with existing platforms, APIs, and infrastructure at scale

### My Approach
I thrive at the intersection of research, engineering, and product strategy. I don't just want to build things, I want to understand why they work, how they can scale, and what impact they'll have. I'm drawn to projects that require simplifying complexity, turning cutting-edge models into practical solutions, and solving real problems that matter to people.

## 🔬 Future Research & Projects
Beyond my past/current work, I'm passionate about pushing boundaries in several frontier areas:
### Physics & Fundamental Theory

* Exploring connections between LLM architectures and physical systems
* Investigating information theory, complexity, and emergent behavior in AI systems
* Bridging computational models with theoretical physics frameworks

### Energy & Sustainability

*  Renewable energy optimization and grid management
* Computational modeling of energy systems
* Intersection of physics, AI, and sustainable technology solutions

### Advanced AI Research

* Novel approaches to LLM interpretability and alignment
* Theory and mathematics underlying transformer architectures
* Multi-agent systems and collective intelligence

I believe the next breakthroughs will come from interdisciplinary thinking—combining rigorous physics intuition with cutting-edge AI capabilities to solve real problems in energy, sustainability, and beyond.

## 🌱 What I'm Learning

* Advanced threat modeling for AI systems
* Scalable business models for consulting services
* Real estate investment strategies in Colombia for building up solar panel farms.
